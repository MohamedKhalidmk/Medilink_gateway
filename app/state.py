"""
Shared LangGraph state for the gateway.

Every node receives a MediLinkState dictionary and returns a partial dictionary
with only the fields it wants to add or update. LangGraph merges those partial
updates into the shared state as the request moves through the pipeline.

Trace rule:
  - main.py creates the input fields.
  - intent_router.py writes routing fields.
  - triage_node.py writes final triage questions.
  - htan_node.py writes HTAN image-analysis fields.
  - vision_node.py writes document/radiology/general-image fields.
  - rag_node.py writes evidence fields.
  - medical_llm.py writes draft answer and citation checks.
  - report_generator.py writes final_answer and doctor_report.
